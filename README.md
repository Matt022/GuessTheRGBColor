# GuessTheRGBColor Game

This project is game about guessing the RGB color for designers.

## What is this game about and how to play this game?

On the right side you can generate the RGB color. It is just randomize the color. When we get some RGB color, our task is guess the color on left side.
As RGB color has three colors (red, green, blue) we can see three inputs for those numbers from 0 to 255 for each value.

After evaluating the results, the median between each RGB color value is calculated, so we have 3 medians, then they are added together and the score comes out.
Less score, better you are.

The aim of the game is to guess the generated color as accurately as possible. Of course there is very low percentage that someone will guess it exactly and that's the point.
Challenge yourself how you know RGB colors!

## Future plans with this project

In the future, I want to add backend to that project for saving highest or at this point the lowest score and authorize the users.
